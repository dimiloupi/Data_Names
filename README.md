# Data Names
This project's aim was to practice OOP in Python by analyzing birth records.
I designed methods in order to:
- Count the total number of babies born based on gender.
- Return an alphabetically  sorted list of baby names that start with a specific character.
- List names ordered from most-common to least common.
